        <h2>
            But seriously, what is site's purpose?
        </h2>
    
        <p>
            Well, I created this site because I wanted a place to test things y'know?
            I want to do some basic styling, use some basic elements, apply some
            functionality, nothing much really. Sooome might tell you that this site is
            too simple, well, I call it cute! :)
            <br>If you choose to continue using this site you will see some elements
            that do some random stuff, it's nothing impressive but I hope I can look
            back on this in the future and see how far I've come.
        </p>
