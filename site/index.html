    <h2>
        But seriously, what is site's purpose?
    </h2>

    <p>
        Well, I created this site because I wanted a place to test things y'know?
        I want to do some basic styling, use some basic elements, apply some
        functionality, nothing much really. Sooome might tell you that this site is
        too simple, well, I call it cute! :)
        <br> If you choose to continue using this site you will see some elements
        that do some random stuff, it's nothing impressive but I hope I can look
        back on this in the future and see how far I've come.
